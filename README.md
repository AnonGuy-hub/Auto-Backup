# Auto-Backup
This script made in C++ copies everything from one directory to another. This script is only made for Windows because I'm using the xcopy command. 
Two things that i suggest if you want to use it, create a file having the directory what you want to copy and where. Another thing is to change the while loop that when the user presses any button it exits.
